Most of our University websites are not easily viewable on smart devices with small screen (e.g. iOS, Android smartphones). As an example, access the Computer Science website(https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) from a smartphone.

One of the good approaches to fix this is to have an architecture that (1) separates information content from the user-interface and to make available the information as a service (e.g., a web service), and (2) allows thin-client applications for smart devices that consume the information service and render the information in such a way that fits well within the interface paradigm of the device. This is an approach taken by a number of news media providers (such as BBC and New Zealand Herald) to provide a richer experience to the readers. The application constructed in (2) could be a native device application or it could be a responsive web application.

This task looks at the separation of data from the UI, and how such data can be consumed and used in the end-user application.
